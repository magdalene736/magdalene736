- 👋 Hi, I’m @magdalene736
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a front-end web developer or a full-stack web developer. I also plan to create a website for a craft co-op in my local area and to create webpages and websites for others, along with creating apps. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and how to make webpages with it. I plan to learn CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, C, C++, and C#. Finally, I plan to learn Python and the other back-end coding languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving building webpages, websites, and apps, including game apps.
